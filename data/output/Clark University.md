Clark aspires to build an inclusive learning environment that links with our academic mission to build new knowledge and seek truth everywhere. Our university is dynamic, multicultural, and always striving to be better.


We believe each student deserves a learning experience that merges the distinctiveness of the individual with the power of community. Your perspectives, your talents, your history, and your voice are critical toward sustaining a campus that celebrates difference and fosters respect for all.

Clark is committed to ensuring that our classrooms, offices and common spaces are welcoming to all and that everyone who comes to campus feels respected and valued.


Our Office of Diversity and Inclusion takes a broad view of the talents, perspectives, and contributions of all members of the community, and we recognize the richness of humanity reflected in our students, faculty and staff. At Clark we engage in civil, constructive discourse to create a climate of acceptance, one where we understand that our differences, in concert with our commonalities, are the cornerstone for a stronger, more inclusive university.
