A PLACE OF BELONGING

We take a proactive approach to cultivating a welcoming environment for all—because excellence is only attainable when everyone is included, respected and empowered. We invite you to engage in self-reflection and dialogue at one of our campus community centers, join our cultural celebrations and become a social justice leader.







CAMPUS COMMUNITY CENTERS

The campus community centers support your academic success by providing co-curricular learning experiences that promote self-awareness, foster leadership development, encourage dialogue, and challenge traditional notions of diversity.

Diversity at USD
================



Diversity, Inclusion, and Social Justice at USD


We first acknowledge the Kumeyaay Nation, on whose lands our community gathers, who are from here and are still here.


As a Catholic institution, the University of San Diego seeks to represent the diversity and beauty of God’s creation as a way to understand and work to eliminate injustices on our campus, in our local community, and around the world. The University is committed to creating a welcoming, inclusive and collaborative community and values students, faculty and staff from different backgrounds and faith traditions. As a university committed to academic excellence, we strive to include diverse perspectives as a way of maximizing the transformative potential of learning, teaching, and scholarship.







Definitions
-----------


**DIVERSITY** at the University of San Diego results from the intentional gathering of varying perspectives that foster institutional excellence and genuine community relationships. Valuing diversity means recognizing and honoring the strengths each person brings to our community as we collectively confront humanity’s urgent challenges. In teaching and learning, DIVERSITY refers to difference, understood as an historically and socially constructed set of value assumptions about what/who matters that figures essentially in power dynamics from the local to the global. Some differences have been made to matter more than others.


**INCLUSION** describes the institutional processes that incorporate and promote diversity. Inclusion refers how institutional practices, policies, and habits transform to include diverse people and perspectives, especially those from underrepresented and underserved groups. The ongoing and adaptive practice of inclusion impacts campus culture and climate.


**SOCIAL JUSTICE** operates centrally in Catholic social teaching. Social justice entails identifying and contesting processes in which power and privilege utilize diversity for inequitable outcomes along intersecting lines—race, class, gender, sexual orientation, religion, ability, and more— that inhibit democratic empowerment, civil and human rights.


**INCLUSIVE EXCELLENCE** is synonymous with institutional excellence; high-quality education relies on engagement and inclusion with diverse perspectives. Inclusive excellence means commitment to diversity and equity in all of their forms, including a diversity of ideas, of people, and the opportunity to learn from and with diverse peers.


**EQUITY** is the process of modifying practices that have intentionally or unintentionally disadvantaged a particular group. The outcome of equity is that all people have an equal opportunity to succeed in reaching equality in outcomes.
