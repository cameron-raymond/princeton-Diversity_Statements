Diversity Statement | LSU Office of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

Top

Mission
Enhancing diversity at LSU is a core institutional value.
The Office of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (ODEI) is a division of the Office of
                  Academic Affairs committed to fostering inclusive educational opportunities and an
                  equitable workforce environment at LSU. ODEI provides leadership to ensure that diversity
                  is a vital component in all decision-making processes on all administrative, academic,
                  budgetary, and strategic planning fronts. 

To that end, ODEI ensures that LSU as a whole is actively recruiting and supporting
                  a diverse student body while simultaneously recruiting and supporting faculty and
                  staff from diverse backgrounds.

ODEI is also responsible for supervising and guiding professional units whose purpose
                  and mission is to promote understanding and respect for difference. These units include
                  the Office of Multicultural Affairs, the Clarence L. Barney Jr. African American Cultural
                  Center, and the Women’s Center. Similarly, ODEI works closely with University committees,
                  commissions, task forces, and affinity groups whose charge is to support underrepresented
                  LSU community members.

Vision
The core tenants of the ODEI Mission and University Diversity Statement provide a
                  strong platform from which to launch a focused vision of diversity, equity, and inclusion
                  for the next generation of growth and impact institutionally, regionally, nationally
                  and globally. 

Our Vision is centered on five areas that will build upon and expand the current framework
                  of ODEI:

Commitment to positively impacting the University’s Mission and The LSU Strategic
                  Plan 2025Providing enthusiastic leadership and support for Faculty recruitment, retention,
                  training, program development, curriculum enhancements and research opportunitiesDelivering holistic, success oriented, structured, pathways for student access, support,
                  and success through degree completion and eventual membership into the alumni communityImproving campus climate and preparing University citizens to be culturally aware,
                  engaged locally and connected globallyDeveloping collaborative partnerships and shared leadership internally and externally
                  that will impact the advancement and financial support for the Office of Diversity,
                  Equity & Inclusion and LSU

Diversity Statement
We believe diversity, equity, and inclusion enrich the educational experience of our
                  students, faculty, and staff, and are necessary to prepare all people to thrive personally
                  and professionally in a global society.  Therefore, LSU is firmly committed to an
                  environment that affords respect to all members of our community. We will work to
                  eliminate barriers that any members of our community experience.

To make LSU a place where that can happen, we must recognize and reflect on the inglorious
                  aspects of our history. We now acknowledge the need to confront the ways racism, sexism,
                  ableism, ageism, classism, LGBTQ+ phobia, intolerance based on religion or on national
                  origin, and all forms of bias and exploitation have shaped our everyday lives.

We accept personal and professional responsibility to eliminate bias and oppression
                  wherever they are found. We understand our obligation to speak up when we see bias
                  whether it be in our  teaching, study,  or daily work. Our community will educate
                  themselves proactively and continuously about how to intervene and bring bias to the
                  attention of others with commitment and compassion.

We will hold ourselves accountable for our actions and inactions, and for maintaining
                  intentional, measurable, and meaningful efforts to enhance diversity, equity, and
                  inclusion, including through ongoing evaluation of our policies, practices, and procedures.

Roadmap to Diversity & Inclusion
The Office of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion’s 2020-22 Diversity & Inclusion Roadmap is
                     divided into four subcategories that were the results of four separate subcommittees:
                     campus climate, faculty, students, and staff. Each subcategories is comprised of a
                     set of general recommendations.

Diversity and Inclusion : SLU

Skip to main content

Read SLU's latest messages on COVID-19 or learn more about SLU's summer safeguards and plans for fall 2021.

Diversity and Inclusion at SLU

Here at SLU, we’re committed to diversity, equity and inclusion as values rooted in
                  Ignatian spirituality. Because of this commitment, our students aspire to build communities
                  that are unburdened by discrimination and oppression while advancing the Ignatian
                  concepts of educating the whole person, and forming men and women for and with others.

Faith fuels our commitment to diversity, social justice and solidarity with the St.
                     Louis community. 

We’re proud to be the first historically white institution of higher education in
                  a former slave state to formally admit African-American students. We’re also proud
                  that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered a civil rights speech on our campus just one week before he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

In our more recent history, student and community activists held a demonstration on
                  campus to protest racial injustices locally and nationally. The 2014 protest ended
                  peacefully with the Clock Tower Accords, a 13-point agreement that aligns with our mission and will further our goal to become
                  a national model for diversity and community engagement.

Diversity Action Plan 4 High Performance

July 13, 2020

There is an old saying; There are only two days in the year that nothing can be done.
                                       One is called ""Yesterday"" and the other is called  ""Tomorrow"" — fortunately we are
                                       in Today!

Let me pause for a moment and acknowledge each of you. Organizational culture change
                                       is not easy and can cause stress, therefore we are being extremely thoughtful and
                                       attentive to your input and perspectives. We recognize that during periods of change
                                       people wonder how they will be impacted.

As society changes, as our institution changes, you may be focused on what you will
                                       lose, not what you will gain. You may also be thinking, ""How will I be affected by
                                       this change? Will I benefit from it? Will I be able to learn what I need to know?""

Beyond the Expected
Bridging the Racial Divide: Being an Ally
In this episode of “Beyond the Expected,” we’ll be talking about being an ally — what
                                       it is, how to do it and why it’s so important in today’s racially, ethnically and
                                       politically divided society. Two Stony Brook experts talk with Stony Brook University
                                       Vice President of Equity and Inclusion and Chief Diversity Officer Judith Brown Clarke
                                       about the emotional toll prejudice takes on individuals across our campus and in society
                                       today, and how ‘Being an Ally’ can help ease the pain.

Caring, Respect, Civility Website Is Here to Help
Stony Brook University’s mission, vision and very essence are built on the principles
                                             of providing equal access to world-class education in a 
                                             caring  environment, where we 
                                             respect and embrace our differences, take responsibility to protect our local communities,
                                             and practice 
                                             civility at all times. We promote inclusion, welcome freedom of expression, encourage civil
                                             discourse, and take a firm stand against divisiveness and insensitivity in all venues
                                             and forms. 

This site – 
                                             Caring, Respect, Civility – provides resources and support to help us all remember these values and practice
                                             these behaviors. This is more important than ever in today’s challenging and changing
                                             educational, political and social climate. Together, we can stay Stony Brook Strong,
                                             and continue to build and role model the culture that is the hallmark of our University.

Stony Brook's Diversity and Civility

A Message from the Chief Diversity Officer
Dear Campus Community,
""They heard us!""
With this heartfelt intention, I had to find words to convey that this moment in time
                                    had the power to be different from other failed moments in time. So, what is different?
                                    Being sick and tired of being sick and tired! ( 
                                    Fannie Lou Hamer).

We can’t control the world, but we can optimize ours. Clearly words are not actions,
                                    and credibility is deeply rooted in relationships and earned trust. We are all life-time
                                    learners, inspired by the saying, when you know better, you do better…and I always
                                    add, then you are better!

Statement from Michael Bernstein and Maurie McInnis on the Tragic Death of George Floyd
Recent events of the past few months have served as a profound reminder of the deep-seated
                                    racism, discrimination, and violence that plague the United States. As we reel over
                                    the senseless murders of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor and remain outraged over
                                    the inexcusable actions of Amy Cooper, our nation confronts another devastating instance
                                    of police brutality.

The killing of George Floyd serves as another painful example of the systemic racial
                                    disparities present in our country.

The Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (ODEI) leads and supports initiatives that promote equity and inclusion, develops and improves collaborative relationships, cultivates a community that encourages and supports a climate that affirms diverse cultures, and advocates for equitable policies, procedures and opportunities for the University of La Verne campus community.
In alignment with the University of La Verne’s core values and strategic plan, the ODEI is dedicated to supporting a diverse community and inclusive environment where students, faculty, and staff respect each other and value the life experiences and viewpoints of others. While great strides have been made over the years to build an inclusive and welcoming culture, we know that there is more work to be done. The following areas of opportunity will guide the ODEI 2025 Inclusive Action Plan initiatives and journey to support the campus community:

Creating a more inclusive climate and experience by improving education and training, cultural understanding, programming and support for curriculum integration.
Recruiting and retaining more diverse faculty, staff, and student persons.
Cultivating a culture of trust and collaboration where the campus as a whole works together to ensure a holistic diversity and inclusion agenda across the university community.
Encouraging dialogue across identity differences to promote development, understanding, reflection, and respect.
Identifying and removing barriers across programs and services to increase equitable practices.

In alignment with the above-mentioned directives, twenty campus leaders who recently engaged in the USC Equity Institute, are leading equity initiatives in the following areas:

Supporting diversity, equity, & inclusion through Promotion & Tenure
Closing equity gaps in student retention
Where are we as a Hispanic Serving Institution? Moving beyond Hispanic enrolling
Manage and eliminate barriers in hiring and retaining diverse faculty and staff

These ongoing efforts will help to promote a more inclusive environment, strengthen our community, and better prepare our students for life in a diverse society after their time at the University of La Verne. We are #LeosTogether on this journey and we will be successful with your support. Thank you for your commitment!
Connect with the Office of Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion on Instagram @Diversity_ULV and keep us in the loop on your diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts by using #LeosTogether on your posts.

Diversity Statement

Our Shared Commitment

Loyola University Chicago fosters a transformative cultural experience that honors diversity and social justice. Its Jesuit Catholic Heritage is founded in equality much like the relationship of God with each and every one of us, of love, care, and oneness. Our commitment to diversity comes from Ignatius himself and the Jesuit belief that God is to be found in the “other,”—in the person, the place, the culture, the context and the human experience that differs from one’s own. This is part of what Ignatius means when he says that God is to be found “in all things.” This foundational principle embraces inclusivity, mutual respect, inherent freedoms, and the dignity of giving each perspective a voice. We aspire to build on this foundation as ambassadors of change, claiming from the heart as well as the mind, our social responsibility in challenging times.
The end goal of diversity on our campuses is not simply a representation of the beauty of “otherness,” of diversity. Rather, we recognize a common unity that anchors and enlivens our commitment to inclusion and creates brave spaces for dialogue to happen, through initiatives that educate the masses. We will hold ourselves accountable to this intentional vision through fostering an integrated society. We will do so with the wisdom that each member of our student, faculty, and staff community brings their own unique perspectives, strengths, and critical inquiries to serve our mission. We will continuously evaluate our commitment to diversity through conscious engagement with its manifestation across the local and global world we live in today.

Regents Policy 4400: Policy on University of California Diversity Statement
| Board of Regents

Regents Policy 4400: Policy on University of California Diversity Statement
Adopted September 20, 2007
                          Amended September 16, 2010
RECOMMENDED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BY THE 
                          ACADEMIC SENATE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

 Adopted by the Assembly of the Academic Senate 
                          May 10, 2006 Endorsed by the President of the University 
                          of California June 30, 2006
                          Adopted as Amended by the Assembly of the Academic Senate April 22, 2009
                          Endorsed as Amended by the President of the University of California August 17, 2010

 The diversity of the people of California has been 
                          the source of innovative ideas and creative accomplishments 
                          throughout the state’s history into the present. 
                          Diversity – a defining feature of California’s 
                          past, present, and future – refers to the variety 
                          of personal experiences, values, and worldviews that 
                          arise from differences of culture and circumstance. 
                          Such differences include race, ethnicity, gender, age, 
                          religion, language, abilities/disabilities, sexual orientation, 
                          gender identity, socioeconomic status, and geographic region, and more. 

Because the core mission of the University of California 
                          is to serve the interests of the State of California, 
                          it must seek to achieve diversity among its student 
                          bodies and among its employees. The State of California 
                          has a compelling interest in making sure that people 
                          from all backgrounds perceive that access to the University 
                          is possible for talented students, staff, and faculty 
                          from all groups. The knowledge that the University of 
                          California is open to qualified students from all groups, 
                          and thus serves all parts of the community equitably, 
                          helps sustain the social fabric of the State.

 Diversity should also be integral to the University’s 
                          achievement of excellence. Diversity can enhance the 
                          ability of the University to accomplish its academic 
                          mission. Diversity aims to broaden and deepen both the 
                          educational experience and the scholarly environment, 
                          as students and faculty learn to interact effectively 
                          with each other, preparing them to participate in an 
                          increasingly complex and pluralistic society. Ideas, 
                          and practices based on those ideas, can be made richer 
                          by the process of being born and nurtured in a diverse 
                          community. The pluralistic university can model a process 
                          of proposing and testing ideas through respectful, civil 
                          communication. Educational excellence that truly incorporates 
                          diversity thus can promote mutual respect and make possible 
                          the full, effective use of the talents and abilities 
                          of all to foster innovation and train future leadership.

 Therefore, the University of California renews its 
                          commitment to the full realization of its historic promise 
                          to recognize and nurture merit, talent, and achievement 
                          by supporting diversity and equal opportunity in its 
                          education, services, and administration, as well as 
                          research and creative activity. The University particularly 
                          acknowledges the acute need to remove barriers to the 
                          recruitment, retention, and advancement of talented 
                          students, faculty, and staff from historically excluded 
                          populations who are currently underrepresented.

Diversity, Inclusion, and Social Justice at USD
We first acknowledge the Kumeyaay Nation, on whose lands our community gathers, who are from here and are still here.
As a Catholic institution, the University of San Diego seeks to represent the diversity and beauty of God’s creation as a way to understand and work to eliminate injustices on our campus, in our local community, and around the world. The University is committed to creating a welcoming, inclusive and collaborative community and values students, faculty and staff from different backgrounds and faith traditions. As a university committed to academic excellence, we strive to include diverse perspectives as a way of maximizing the transformative potential of learning, teaching, and scholarship.

Definitions
DIVERSITY at the University of San Diego results from the intentional gathering of varying perspectives that foster institutional excellence and genuine community relationships. Valuing diversity means recognizing and honoring the strengths each person brings to our community as we collectively confront humanity’s urgent challenges. In teaching and learning, DIVERSITY refers to difference, understood as an historically and socially constructed set of value assumptions about what/who matters that figures essentially in power dynamics from the local to the global. Some differences have been made to matter more than others.
INCLUSION describes the institutional processes that incorporate and promote diversity. Inclusion refers how institutional practices, policies, and habits transform to include diverse people and perspectives, especially those from underrepresented and underserved groups. The ongoing and adaptive practice of inclusion impacts campus culture and climate.
SOCIAL JUSTICE operates centrally in Catholic social teaching. Social justice entails identifying and contesting processes in which power and privilege utilize diversity for inequitable outcomes along intersecting lines—race, class, gender, sexual orientation, religion, ability, and more— that inhibit democratic empowerment, civil and human rights.
INCLUSIVE EXCELLENCE is synonymous with institutional excellence; high-quality education relies on engagement and inclusion with diverse perspectives. Inclusive excellence means commitment to diversity and equity in all of their forms, including a diversity of ideas, of people, and the opportunity to learn from and with diverse peers.
EQUITY is the process of modifying practices that have intentionally or unintentionally disadvantaged a particular group. The outcome of equity is that all people have an equal opportunity to succeed in reaching equality in outcomes.

Institutional Outcomes
Cultural Self-Awareness

In relating to others, works to identify one’s own unexamined cultural attitudes, and behaviors, reflected in one’s values, spirituality, and faith traditions.
Recognizes one’s own constellation of identities and their meanings. Is exposed to people who hold different identities than one’s own and values intrinsically these differences.

Engaging with Difference

Engages with, supports, and validates diverse points of view
Communicate ideas, perspectives, and values clearly and persuasively while listening openly to others
Interact effectively with others through the willingness to explore the challenge of difference to reap the benefits of working competently in cross-cultural situations.

Community Engagement

Create an inclusive community that fosters an understanding and respect for diversity among our students, faculty, staff, and administrators. 
Encourages connections between civic and academic communities to promote engagement and action to achieve common goals.

Mission and Vision

Excellence, Diversity & Inclusion: Making the University & World Work Better for All
A diversity of people and ideas, together with a climate that fosters the inclusion
                     of that diversity in shaping the very fabric of what we do, is essential for excellence
                     in research, learning and teaching, and service to our community, nation and world.
                     Stony Brook University has come a long way in enhancing diversity, as evidenced by
                     the ""Portal to Diversity Programs"" and the many other important efforts throughout
                     our University. Our work is not done—and never will be finished! With a clear recognition
                     of both the influence of the past on present conditions and the challenges ahead,
                     we, like other universities, must nurture diverse talents across such areas as natural
                     sciences and engineering, social sciences, humanities, and business. We must be vigilant
                     in recognizing potential, in creating a community of scholars, and in developing leaders
                     that will use holistic approaches to address problems and issues.

Stony Brook University has been very successful in creating communities, aided by
                     substantial peer learning and social support, to enhance the success of underrepresented
                     groups. Within the next five years, our University will build on these successes to
                     address several areas:

broaden participation in undergraduate and graduate programs, with special attention
                        to understanding the factors that support or hinder student success in selected disciplines,

grow the participation of underrepresented groups among the faculty and professional
                        staff,

enhance the campus climate so that current members and future members excel. To achieve
                        our aims, our University will expand its scholarship in diversity and inclusion, use
                        its lessons learned from over three decades of diversity work, and continue to explore
                        promising national models.

GW Statement on Diversity and Inclusion | Diversity & Inclusion | The George Washington University

The George Washington University Statement on Diversity and Inclusion Diversity is crucial to an educational institution's pursuit of excellence in learning, research and service. In pursuit of those goals, a population of students, faculty, and staff with differing perspectives, backgrounds, talents and needs can lead to a richer mix of ideas, energizing and enlightening debates, deeper commitments, and a host of educational, civic and work outcomes.
Leveraging diversity is rarely achieved by accident. As individuals and as an institution, we must intentionally act to create the diverse and inclusive community that enables everyone to flourish. All members and units of the George Washington University community must advance the institution’s commitment to diversity and inclusion as a strategic priority.
The following principles guide our conduct and decision-making: 
Students 
The university is committed to recruiting, admitting and enrolling undergraduate and graduate students drawn from varying backgrounds or identities throughout all schools and departments.
Faculty and Staff Workforce 
The university is committed to recruiting, interviewing and hiring faculty, staff, and senior administrators drawn from varying backgrounds and identities throughout all departments and schools.
Board and Council Membership 
The university’s governing and advisory bodies reflect the rich diversity of our community and the geographic community in which we reside.
Community Partners
The university shares its commitment to diversity and inclusion with its local, national and international partners and seeks partners that reflect the diversity of our community. Organizations with a proven record of a commitment to diversity and an ongoing demonstration of these values in their governing and employment practices, delivery of products and services, and organizational philosophies are given strong consideration in competitive circumstances.
Teaching and Research 
Diversity is of vital importance to the university’s intellectual mission. Various perspectives inform GW’s curricular, co-curricular, and research endeavors resulting in creative and innovative outcomes and helping attract and retain individuals with diverse backgrounds. In addition these activities give faculty and students an opportunity to engage in rigorous critical analysis of cultural, ethnic, racial, and other related differences.
Inclusion
The university holds its members accountable for sustaining an academic, work and social environment that values open communication, respectful interactions, and civility. We have a shared responsibility for the well being of others.
