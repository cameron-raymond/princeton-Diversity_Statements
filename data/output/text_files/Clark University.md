Clark aspires to build an inclusive learning environment that links with our academic mission to build new knowledge and seek truth everywhere. Our university is dynamic, multicultural, and always striving to be better.
We believe each student deserves a learning experience that merges the distinctiveness of the individual with the power of community. Your perspectives, your talents, your history, and your voice are critical toward sustaining a campus that celebrates difference and fosters respect for all.
