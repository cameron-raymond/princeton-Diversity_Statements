The Office for Institutional Equity (OIE) provides education and support for the Duke University and Duke Health community to advance Duke's shared values of respect, trust, inclusion, discovery, and excellence. OIE responds to and supports the prevention of complaints of discrimination, harassment and sexual misconduct. OIE also publishes the annual Affirmative Action Program and can provide education, data and other resources to support hiring and promotion practices to encourage diversity. Finally, the office offers outreach, education, team building & coaching, and diversity publications in support of the Duke community. OIE collaborates internally and externally to best leverage its resources to support all students, staff and faculty at Duke.

#### Reporting an Incident

Use the confidential online Incident Reporting tool to provide OIE with preliminary information concerning incidents of protected status harassment, discrimination and related misconduct involving students, faculty, or staff. OIE will respond to all submissions regardless of the nature of the report, and will forward it to the office responsible for addressing it, as appropriate. Though the form may be submitted anonymously, Duke University cannot provide supportive measures (such as academic accommodations, no-contact orders, safe housing options, changes of work schedules) with anonymous submissions. In addition, anonymous reports may also impact the University's ability to investigate and/or take disciplinary action

* Duke’s Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion

 Duke’s Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion
============================================

Duke aspires to create a community built on collaboration, innovation, creativity, and belonging. Our collective success depends on the robust exchange of ideas—an exchange that is best when the rich diversity of our perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences flourishes. To achieve this exchange, it is essential that all members of the community feel secure and welcome, that the contributions of all individuals are respected, and that all voices are heard. All members of our community have a responsibility to uphold these values.

Excellence, Diversity and InclusionA statement by the faculty, Provost, and President
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To achieve our mission and meet the needs of a rapidly changing world, Duke strives to create a climate of collaboration, creativity, and innovation within and across disciplines.  Our success depends upon the robust exchange of ideas – an exchange that flourishes best when the rich diversity of human knowledge, perspectives, and experiences is heard.  We nonetheless acknowledge that our policies and practices have often failed to ensure equality of participation within our community.  Our renewed commitment and responsibility to one another is articulated in the following statement.

Duke University Community Commitment
------------------------------------

Because diversity is essential to fulfilling the university’s mission, Duke is committed to building an inclusive and diverse university community.  Every student, faculty, and staff member —whatever their race, gender, age, ethnicity, cultural heritage or nationality; religious or political beliefs; sexual orientation or gender identity; or socioeconomic, veteran or ability status—has the right to inclusion, respect, agency and voice in the Duke community.  Further, all members of the University community have a responsibility to uphold these values and actively foster full participation in university life.

Community Standard
------------------

Duke has a longstanding [community standard](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct/about-us/duke-community-standard), which all students sign and pledge to keep.  Duke University is a community dedicated to scholarship, leadership, and service and to the principles of honesty, fairness, respect, and accountability.
