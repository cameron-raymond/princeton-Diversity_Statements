 Duke’s Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion
============================================


 

Duke aspires to create a community built on collaboration, innovation, creativity, and belonging. Our collective success depends on the robust exchange of ideas—an exchange that is best when the rich diversity of our perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences flourishes. To achieve this exchange, it is essential that all members of the community feel secure and welcome, that the contributions of all individuals are respected, and that all voices are heard. All members of our community have a responsibility to uphold these values.


Excellence, Diversity and InclusionA statement by the faculty, Provost, and President
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


To achieve our mission and meet the needs of a rapidly changing world, Duke strives to create a climate of collaboration, creativity, and innovation within and across disciplines.  Our success depends upon the robust exchange of ideas – an exchange that flourishes best when the rich diversity of human knowledge, perspectives, and experiences is heard.  We nonetheless acknowledge that our policies and practices have often failed to ensure equality of participation within our community.  Our renewed commitment and responsibility to one another is articulated in the following statement.


Duke University Community Commitment
------------------------------------


Because diversity is essential to fulfilling the university’s mission, Duke is committed to building an inclusive and diverse university community.  Every student, faculty, and staff member —whatever their race, gender, age, ethnicity, cultural heritage or nationality; religious or political beliefs; sexual orientation or gender identity; or socioeconomic, veteran or ability status—has the right to inclusion, respect, agency and voice in the Duke community.  Further, all members of the University community have a responsibility to uphold these values and actively foster full participation in university life.


Community Standard
------------------


Duke has a longstanding [community standard](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct/about-us/duke-community-standard), which all students sign and pledge to keep.  Duke University is a community dedicated to scholarship, leadership, and service and to the principles of honesty, fairness, respect, and accountability.
