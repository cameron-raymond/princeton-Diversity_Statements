Diversity Statement
===================

Our Shared Commitment
---------------------

Loyola University Chicago fosters a transformative cultural experience that honors diversity and social justice. Its Jesuit Catholic Heritage is founded in equality much like the relationship of God with each and every one of us, of love, care, and oneness. Our commitment to diversity comes from Ignatius himself and the Jesuit belief that God is to be found in the “other,”—in the person, the place, the culture, the context and the human experience that differs from one’s own. This is part of what Ignatius means when he says that God is to be found “in all things.” This foundational principle embraces inclusivity, mutual respect, inherent freedoms, and the dignity of giving each perspective a voice. We aspire to build on this foundation as ambassadors of change, claiming from the heart as well as the mind, our social responsibility in challenging times.

The end goal of diversity on our campuses is not simply a representation of the beauty of “otherness,” of diversity. Rather, we recognize a common unity that anchors and enlivens our commitment to inclusion and creates brave spaces for dialogue to happen, through initiatives that educate the masses. We will hold ourselves accountable to this intentional vision through fostering an integrated society. We will do so with the wisdom that each member of our student, faculty, and staff community brings their own unique perspectives, strengths, and critical inquiries to serve our mission. We will continuously evaluate our commitment to diversity through conscious engagement with its manifestation across the local and global world we live in today.
