 SUNY Strategic Plan
-------------------

 *"At SUNY, we recognize our diversity makes us stronger and smarter. We respect, encourage, and promote all aspects of human difference. Diversity enriches lives and the educational experience. By capitalizing on diversity, our SUNY campuses invigorate conversations, awaken curiosity, foster civic engagement, and widen perspectives.Beyond being a pathway to culturally competent employment, SUNY campuses are also the training grounds for many future corporate and community leaders. As the Supreme Court recognized, the path to leadership should be visibly open to talented and qualified individuals of every race and ethnicity in order to cultivate a set of leaders with legitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry. The SUNY student body is sewn from the threads of our nation's diverse quilt, where the views of all students across the educational spectrum are sought out and given voice."*
