Diversity and Inclusion at SLU
==============================

Here at SLU, we’re committed to diversity, equity and inclusion as values rooted in
 Ignatian spirituality. Because of this commitment, our students aspire to build communities
 that are unburdened by discrimination and oppression while advancing the Ignatian
 concepts of educating the whole person, and forming men and women for and with others.

Faith fuels our commitment to diversity, social justice and solidarity with the St.
 Louis community. 

We’re proud to be the first historically white institution of higher education in
 a former slave state to formally admit African-American students. We’re also proud
 that [Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered a civil rights speech on our campus](/alumni-and-donors/news/mlk-slu-visit.php "Alumni Recall Dr. King's 1964 Visit to SLU") just one week before he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

In our more recent history, student and community activists held a demonstration on
 campus to protest racial injustices locally and nationally. The 2014 protest ended
 peacefully with the [Clock Tower Accords](/about/key-facts/diversity/clock-towers-accords.php "Clock Tower Accords"), a 13-point agreement that aligns with our mission and will further our goal to become
 a national model for diversity and community engagement.
