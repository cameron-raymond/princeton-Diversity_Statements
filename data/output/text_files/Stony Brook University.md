 Diversity Action Plan 4 High Performance
========================================

*July 13, 2020*

There is an old saying; There are only two days in the year that nothing can be done.
 One is called "Yesterday" and the other is called  "Tomorrow" — fortunately we are
 in Today!

Let me pause for a moment and acknowledge each of you. Organizational culture change
 is not easy and can cause stress, therefore we are being extremely thoughtful and
 attentive to your input and perspectives. We recognize that during periods of change
 people wonder how they will be impacted.

As society changes, as our institution changes, you may be focused on what you will
 lose, not what you will gain. You may also be thinking, "How will I be affected by
 this change? Will I benefit from it? Will I be able to learn what I need to know?"

#### Beyond the Expected

###### Bridging the Racial Divide: Being an Ally

In this episode of “Beyond the Expected,” we’ll be talking about being an ally — what
 it is, how to do it and why it’s so important in today’s racially, ethnically and
 politically divided society. Two Stony Brook experts talk with Stony Brook University
 Vice President of Equity and Inclusion and Chief Diversity Officer Judith Brown Clarke
 about the emotional toll prejudice takes on individuals across our campus and in society
 today, and how ‘Being an Ally’ can help ease the pain.

 #### Caring, Respect, Civility Website Is Here to Help

Stony Brook University’s mission, vision and very essence are built on the principles
 of providing equal access to world-class education in a 
 **caring**  environment, where we 
 **respect** and embrace our differences, take responsibility to protect our local communities,
 and practice 
 **civility** at all times. We promote inclusion, welcome freedom of expression, encourage civil
 discourse, and take a firm stand against divisiveness and insensitivity in all venues
 and forms. 

This site – 
 **Caring, Respect, Civility** – provides resources and support to help us all remember these values and practice
 these behaviors. This is more important than ever in today’s challenging and changing
 educational, political and social climate. Together, we can stay Stony Brook Strong,
 and continue to build and role model the culture that is the hallmark of our University.

 Stony Brook's Diversity and Civility

 A Message from the Chief Diversity Officer
==========================================

Dear Campus Community,

"They heard us!"

With this heartfelt intention, I had to find words to convey that this moment in time
 had the power to be different from other failed moments in time. So, what is different?
 Being sick and tired of being sick and tired! ( 
 [Fannie Lou Hamer](https://t.e2ma.net/click/9diy6b/l3pe4l/5mydfi)).

We can’t control the world, but we can optimize ours. Clearly words are not actions,
 and credibility is deeply rooted in relationships and earned trust. We are all life-time
 learners, inspired by the saying, when you know better, you do better…and I always
 add, then you are better!

 Statement from Michael Bernstein and Maurie McInnis on the Tragic Death of George Floyd
=======================================================================================

Recent events of the past few months have served as a profound reminder of the deep-seated
 racism, discrimination, and violence that plague the United States. As we reel over
 the senseless murders of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor and remain outraged over
 the inexcusable actions of Amy Cooper, our nation confronts another devastating instance
 of police brutality.

The killing of George Floyd serves as another painful example of the systemic racial
 disparities present in our country.

### Excellence, Diversity & Inclusion: Making the University & World Work Better for All

A diversity of people and ideas, together with a climate that fosters the inclusion
 of that diversity in shaping the very fabric of what we do, is essential for excellence
 in research, learning and teaching, and service to our community, nation and world.
 Stony Brook University has come a long way in enhancing diversity, as evidenced by
 the "Portal to Diversity Programs" and the many other important efforts throughout
 our University. Our work is not done—and never will be finished! With a clear recognition
 of both the influence of the past on present conditions and the challenges ahead,
 we, like other universities, must nurture diverse talents across such areas as natural
 sciences and engineering, social sciences, humanities, and business. We must be vigilant
 in recognizing potential, in creating a community of scholars, and in developing leaders
 that will use holistic approaches to address problems and issues.

Stony Brook University has been very successful in creating communities, aided by
 substantial peer learning and social support, to enhance the success of underrepresented
 groups. Within the next five years, our University will build on these successes to
 address several areas:

1. broaden participation in undergraduate and graduate programs, with special attention
 to understanding the factors that support or hinder student success in selected disciplines,
2. grow the participation of underrepresented groups among the faculty and professional
 staff,
3. enhance the campus climate so that current members and future members excel. To achieve
 our aims, our University will expand its scholarship in diversity and inclusion, use
 its lessons learned from over three decades of diversity work, and continue to explore
 promising national models.
