The University of California at Santa Barbara is committed to promoting excellence through diversity and inclusiveness. The campus community, in keeping with the academic mission of the University of California to educate its residents, strives to create an environment that is welcoming for all sectors of our state's diverse population and that is conducive to the development of each individual's highest potential. In addition, our campus upholds the principle of equal opportunity for all since equal opportunity fosters the best conditions possible for the enhancement of research, creativity, innovation, and excellence.

UCSB adheres to the [University of California Diversity statement](http://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/governance/policies/4400.html) which underscores the importance of educating our diverse population.

Dear UCSB Community Members:

I am pleased to join the UC Santa Barbara community as the inaugural Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. I appreciate the vision that Chancellor Yang demonstrates through his ongoing commitment to grow, expand, and support the Office for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion that reflects his embrace of the core principles that the Office represents.

DIVERSITY, EQUITY, and INCLUSION are more than just words, they are our CORE principles that must guide our vision and, more importantly, our actions. They must serve as pillars for community building. These CORE principles guide how we at UC Santa Barbara must build our teams, cultivate our leaders and create an organizational culture that values diversity, equity, inclusion, and social justice as the **building blocks** of excellence.

During my first days on the job, I have met many administrators, faculty, staff, and students who are equally committed to these principles. You have been working tirelessly, and I am humbled by your efforts and accomplishments. I am also appreciative of the groundwork laid by my predecessor, DEI Associate Vice Chancellor, Maria Herrera Sobek.

In 2015, UCSB became the first member of the Association of American Universities to be designated as a Hispanic-Serving Institution, and we are also an Asian American Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institution, both designated by the U.S. Department of Education.  My vision is to build a truly diverse and inclusive campus that fosters an environment where each member is empowered to bring their unique differences, points of view, and contributions to the University; where they will experience acceptance, respect, inclusion and the support needed to achieve their full academic, personal, and professional potential.

[**Please take a moment to read my full letter of introduction**](/communications/2020-10-13-letter-introduction)

I look forward to working with you to further promote a culture that fosters a sense of belonging for ALL members of the UCSB community.

Sincerely,  

*Belinda Robnett*

Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

UC Santa Barbara is a dream school for many because of its proximity to some of the finest beaches in Southern California and in the country, but it's also a school with a long record of striving for diversity — in fact, the entire UC network can say the same. Like SoCal itself, UC Santa Barbara is home to a prominent Hispanic community spread across the faculty, staff, and student body. [In 2015](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/uc-leads-nations-top-universities-serving-latino-students) it became the fourth UC campus and the first member of the American Association of Universities to be named a Hispanic-Serving Institution.

Regents Policy 4400: Policy on University of California Diversity Statement
===========================================================================

*Adopted September 20, 2007  

 Amended September 16, 2010*
RECOMMENDED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BY THE 
 ACADEMIC SENATE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

 *Adopted by the Assembly of the Academic Senate 
 May 10, 2006 Endorsed by the President of the University 
 of California June 30, 2006  

 Adopted as Amended by the Assembly of the Academic Senate April 22, 2009  

 Endorsed as Amended by the President of the University of California August 17, 2010*

 The diversity of the people of California has been 
 the source of innovative ideas and creative accomplishments 
 throughout the state’s history into the present. 
 Diversity – a defining feature of California’s 
 past, present, and future – refers to the variety 
 of personal experiences, values, and worldviews that 
 arise from differences of culture and circumstance. 
 Such differences include race, ethnicity, gender, age, 
 religion, language, abilities/disabilities, sexual orientation, 
 gender identity, socioeconomic status, and geographic region, and more. 

Because the core mission of the University of California 
 is to serve the interests of the State of California, 
 it must seek to achieve diversity among its student 
 bodies and among its employees. The State of California 
 has a compelling interest in making sure that people 
 from all backgrounds perceive that access to the University 
 is possible for talented students, staff, and faculty 
 from all groups. The knowledge that the University of 
 California is open to qualified students from all groups, 
 and thus serves all parts of the community equitably, 
 helps sustain the social fabric of the State.

 Diversity should also be integral to the University’s 
 achievement of excellence. Diversity can enhance the 
 ability of the University to accomplish its academic 
 mission. Diversity aims to broaden and deepen both the 
 educational experience and the scholarly environment, 
 as students and faculty learn to interact effectively 
 with each other, preparing them to participate in an 
 increasingly complex and pluralistic society. Ideas, 
 and practices based on those ideas, can be made richer 
 by the process of being born and nurtured in a diverse 
 community. The pluralistic university can model a process 
 of proposing and testing ideas through respectful, civil 
 communication. Educational excellence that truly incorporates 
 diversity thus can promote mutual respect and make possible 
 the full, effective use of the talents and abilities 
 of all to foster innovation and train future leadership.

 Therefore, the University of California renews its 
 commitment to the full realization of its historic promise 
 to recognize and nurture merit, talent, and achievement 
 by supporting diversity and equal opportunity in its 
 education, services, and administration, as well as 
 research and creative activity. The University particularly 
 acknowledges the acute need to remove barriers to the 
 recruitment, retention, and advancement of talented 
 students, faculty, and staff from historically excluded 
 populations who are currently underrepresented.
