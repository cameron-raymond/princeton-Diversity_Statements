Core Values

**Inclusive Excellence:** DEI posits that inclusive excellence requires a healthy and inclusive campus climate and refers to the processes by which we leverage diversity as our strength to enhance our understanding and connections with diverse communities, ensure the success of all of our students and advance the academic enterprise.

**Promoting Equity:** DEI believes in the residual value of equity and fosters a climate where fairness, impartiality, and justice are a main staple in the relationships between and among people of all backgrounds within UNM’s social and professional settings.

**Social Justice:** DEI strongly advocates for an institution based on principles of fairness, solidarity, understanding and value.
