Mission Statement
-----------------

The Division for Equity and Inclusion promotes equity for all members of the University community by leading efforts and building sustainable partnerships to transform the campus environment, in addition to fostering inclusive excellence, promoting equity, and advocating social justice; and, in this way, nurture a climate that imbues diversity as an asset.

Vision Statement
----------------

Since the University of New Mexico looks today, like most universities will look tomorrow, UNM will become a model for diversity and inclusive excellence.

Core Values
-----------

**Inclusive Excellence:** DEI posits that inclusive excellence requires a healthy and inclusive campus climate and refers to the processes by which we leverage diversity as our strength to enhance our understanding and connections with diverse communities, ensure the success of all of our students and advance the academic enterprise.

**Promoting Equity:** DEI believes in the residual value of equity and fosters a climate where fairness, impartiality, and justice are a main staple in the relationships between and among people of all backgrounds within UNM’s social and professional settings.

**Social Justice:** DEI strongly advocates for an institution based on principles of fairness, solidarity, understanding and value.

Indigenous Peoples' Land and Territory Acknowledgement
------------------------------------------------------

Founded in 1889, the University of New Mexico sits on the traditional homelands of the Pueblo of Sandia. The original peoples of New Mexico - Pueblo, Navajo, and Apache since time immemorial, have deep connections to the land and have made significant contributions to the broader community statewide. We honor the land itself and those who remain stewards of this land throughout the generations and also acknowledge our committed relationship to Indigenous peoples. We gratefully recognize our history.
