Diversity & Inclusion
=====================

We take great pride in being a welcoming, diverse, and inclusive community that values and celebrates each other's differences.

2. [Vibrant Community](https://www.widener.edu/student-experience/vibrant-community)
3. Diversity & Inclusion

We’re. All. Widener.
--------------------

That’s not just a saying here; it’s a way of life. It represents the culture of our university - a powerful call for respect, mutual understanding, and unity.

Here you'll be embraced and supported by a welcoming and inclusive community regardless of your race, ethnicity, national origin, gender and sexual identity, socioeconomic status, ability, religion, political affiliation, among other things.

You'll join a community of students and scholars who hail from across the country and around the world. Our community is woven together by diverse backgrounds, life experiences, and perspectives, and our classrooms, residence halls, and social spaces are enriched by this variety.

You'll interact with people and engage in the kinds of transformational moments that broaden your own worldview and prepare you for the world and workforce you're about to enter.

### We're All Widener

Our We're All Widener initiative demonstrates an approach and commitment to diversity in which a plurality of viewpoints are valued, explored, and seen as opportunities for learning and personal growth. Our focus on diversity emphasizes three key values: We're all valued. We're all contributors. We're all Widener.

### Multicultural and Interfaith Organizations & Programs

We're home to numerous multicultural and interfaith organizations – including Black Student Union, Sexuality and Gender Alliance, and InterVarsity Christian Fellowship –that enrich our campus and foster an environment where everyone is valued. Educational and social programs unite and inform our community about cultures and traditions represented here and beyond.
