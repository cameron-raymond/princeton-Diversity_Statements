### We're All Widener


Our We're All Widener initiative demonstrates an approach and commitment to diversity in which a plurality of viewpoints are valued, explored, and seen as opportunities for learning and personal growth. Our focus on diversity emphasizes three key values: We're all valued. We're all contributors. We're all Widener.
















### Multicultural and Interfaith Organizations & Programs


We're home to numerous multicultural and interfaith organizations – including Black Student Union, Sexuality and Gender Alliance, and InterVarsity Christian Fellowship –that enrich our campus and foster an environment where everyone is valued. Educational and social programs unite and inform our community about cultures and traditions represented here and beyond.
