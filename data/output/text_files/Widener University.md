### We're All Widener


Our We're All Widener initiative demonstrates an approach and commitment to diversity in which a plurality of viewpoints are valued, explored, and seen as opportunities for learning and personal growth. Our focus on diversity emphasizes three key values: We're all valued. We're all contributors. We're all Widener.
